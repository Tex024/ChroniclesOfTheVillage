# Chronicles of the Village

**Chronicles of the Village** is a modular **social deduction game** inspired by *Werewolf* and *Mafia*.  
Each player receives a **Profession** (public identity) and a **Role** (secret identity).  
The **Narrator** (Master of the Game) guides the story through alternating **Day** and **Night** phases until one side wins.

## Project Structure

### Data Files
- `roles.json` â†’ Defines secret roles (alignments, win conditions, abilities).  
- `professions.json` â†’ Defines professions and their public abilities.  

### Code Modules
- **`core.py`** â†’ Core definitions: `Player`, `Character`, `Role`, `Profession`, `Ability`, `Alignment`.  
- **`parser.py`** â†’ Loads roles and professions from JSON.  
- **`generator.py`** â†’ Randomly assigns characters to players.  
- **`writer.py`** â†’ Generates LaTeX player sheets and the Narratorâ€™s script.

The system generates:
- **Character Sheets** â†’ Personalized LaTeX scrolls for each player.  
- **Narrator Script** â†’ A structured LaTeX guide for the Narrator.
